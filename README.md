# Heat Pump Dashboard

The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that helps determine the efficacy of installing a heat pump depending on the weather in a particular location in the United States.

In short, heat pumps are a reverse air conditioner that can be used to replace a traditional gas-powered furnace through the magic of refrigerant. However, compared to gas-powered furnaces, their efficacy is potentially more dependent on temperature. In particular, heat pumps may struggle at extremely low temperatures. As a result, many potential users are discouraged from electing to install a heat pump over a traditional furnace.

Heat pump manufacturers publish performance specifications, importantly including the coefficient of performance. This information, together with local weather information, can help consumers make informed decisions.
